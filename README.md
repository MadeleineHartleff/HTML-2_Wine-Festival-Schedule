# Wine Festival Schedule

This project is a basic HTML web page designed to display the event schedule 
for the Aguillar Familyâ€™s annual wine festival. The page includes a structured 
table with headings for event times and descriptions to help attendees navigate 
the festival.

## Credits
This project is based on an exercise from 
<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html-tables">Codecademy</a>. 
While the initial task description and the style.css file were provided by 
Codecademy, the HTML file and its structure were fully implemented by me.
